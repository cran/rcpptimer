Description: Provides 'Rcpp' bindings for 'cpptimer', a simple tic-toc timer class for benchmarking 'C++' code <https://github.com/BerriJ/cpptimer>. It's not just simple, it's blazing fast! This sleek tic-toc timer class supports overlapping timers as well as 'OpenMP' parallelism <https://www.openmp.org/>. It boasts a microsecond-level time resolution. We did not find any overhead of the timer itself at this resolution. Results (with summary statistics) are automatically passed back to 'R' as a data frame.
